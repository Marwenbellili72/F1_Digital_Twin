# üèéÔ∏è F1 Digital Twin ‚Äì Real-Time Telemetry System with FIWARE & Grafana

## üìò Introduction

This project implements a **Digital Twin** of a Formula 1 (F1) car using an IoT and data visualization stack based on **FIWARE**, **CrateDB**, and **Grafana**.

### üîç What is a Digital Twin?

A **Digital Twin** is a real-time virtual representation of a physical system‚Äîin this case, an F1 car. It mirrors telemetry data such as speed, RPM, gear, and more. The Digital Twin enables:

- Continuous monitoring of the car‚Äôs performance
- Real-time data visualization
- Simulation for testing strategies or behaviors
- Demonstration of smart mobility/IoT frameworks

## üß† State of the Art ‚Äì Real F1 Telemetry Systems

Digital Twin technology is used heavily in Formula 1.

### üèÅ Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Telemetry Dashboard (Reference)

The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team built a telemetry system capable of showing:

- Live speed, RPM, gear state
- Sector/lap timing and progress
- Tyre pressure, brake temps, fuel levels
- Engine diagnostics and GPS position

## üèóÔ∏è How the Digital Twin is Built

This project emulates the behavior of a Formula 1 car by combining real telemetry from past races with real-time IoT architecture.

### üß™ Data Generation using FastF1

We use the **[FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/)** API to simulate a real F1 race session. This powerful Python library allows us to extract:

- Speed
- RPM
- Gear
- Driver code
- DRS state
- Time within the lap

from actual telemetry logs (e.g., 2022 Monza Grand Prix). These values are updated in real time and **transformed into NGSI v2-compliant entities**, representing the virtual state of the car.

Each entity is structured as an `F1_Car` object and sent to the **FIWARE Orion Context Broker**, which acts as the central receiver of all contextual information.
![fastf1](https://github.com/Marwenbellili72/F1_Digital_Twin/blob/main/assets/img9.png)

### üîÅ Subscription to QuantumLeap

A **subscription** is created between Orion and **QuantumLeap** (a time-series translator). This subscription allows every update on F1_Car entities to be forwarded automatically and stored in **CrateDB**, which acts as a time-series database.

This creates a historical log of car behavior‚Äîexactly like in real F1 data telemetry centers.

### üìä Visualization (Grafana + Streamlit + 3D)

We use a **hybrid visualization** approach:

#### üìà Grafana Dashboards

- A dashboard in Grafana fetches data from CrateDB (via PostgreSQL plugin).
- It visualizes time-series metrics: speed, RPM, gear shifts, and lap timing.
- We use the `htmlgraphics` plugin to **embed custom HTML views** inside Grafana.

#### üñºÔ∏è Streamlit Simulation

To simulate the race visually:
- A **Streamlit app** runs alongside the backend and uses the **FastF1 API** to draw the circuit layout.
- The **driver‚Äôs current position** is plotted live on the track.
- A **3D McLaren car model** is served via **NGINX**, and displayed inside Grafana using the `HTMLGraphics` panel.

This combination allows Grafana to act not only as a metrics dashboard, but as a **real-time cockpit**, mixing charts and 3D visualization.

## üß© System Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end architecture of the F1 Digital Twin platform, integrating telemetry ingestion, data storage, visualization, and simulation components‚Äîall containerized using Docker.

### üîÅ 1. Telemetry Ingestion

- **FastF1** is used to extract real-world race telemetry (e.g., Italian GP 2023).
- Data is injected into the system via a **FastAPI service** (`f1_data_generator`).
- This service communicates with the **FIWARE Orion Context Broker** via port `8000:8000`.
- Manual queries can also be sent using `curl` or **Postman** on port `1026:1026`.

### üì° 2. Context Management (FIWARE)

- The **Orion Context Broker** receives NGSI-v2 entities and forwards them:
  - To **MongoDB** (port `27017`) for temporary storage.
  - To **QuantumLeap** (port `8668`) for time-series processing.
  - Finally, to **CrateDB** (port `4200`) for long-term historical storage.

### üíæ 3. Time-Series Database

- **MongoDB** is used for internal FIWARE context persistence.
- **CrateDB** is the main time-series database queried for dashboards and analytics.
- It holds all telemetry data (speed, RPM, gear, location, lap times, etc.).

### üìä 4. Grafana Visualization

- **Grafana** is connected to CrateDB and visualizes real-time metrics:
  - üöÄ Speed, RPM, Gear
  - üß≠ Car position on track (x, y)
  - ü¶∂ Throttle & Brake pressure
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Lap numbers and time
- Accessible at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

### üß≠ 5. Race Tracker (Streamlit)

- A custom **Streamlit app** simulates the car‚Äôs position during a real race session.
- Uses FastF1 API to track the driver in real time.
- Accessible at [`http://localhost:8501`](http://localhost:8501)

### üöó 6. 3D Car Model Simulation (NGINX)

- A realistic 3D **McLaren F1** model is rendered using **Three.js**.
- Hosted on an **NGINX** server and embedded into Grafana via an `<iframe>`.
- Accessible at [`http://localhost:8081`](http://localhost:8081)

### üê≥ 7. Dockerized Deployment

- All components are containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated via **Docker Compose**.
- Each service runs on its own port, enabling modular and scalable integration.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Notification Subscription

To enable real-time updates from the Orion Context Broker to QuantumLeap (or any consumer), a **notification subscription** must be created.

This is done by sending a `POST` request to Orion's `/v2/subscriptions` endpoint. Below is an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify QuantumLeap of F1 Car Telemetry Changes including position",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": ".*",
        "type": "Car"
      }
    ],
    "condition": {
      "attrs": [ "speed", "rpm", "gear", "throttle", "brake", "drs", "distance", "lapNumber", "timeWithinLap", "simulatedElapsedTime", "x", "y" ]
    }
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://quantumleap:8668/v2/notify"
    },
    "attrs": [ "speed", "rpm", "gear", "throttle", "brake", "drs", "distance", "driverCode", "lapNumber", "timeWithinLap", "simulatedElapsedTime", "simulationSessionKey", "x", "y" ],
    "metadata": [ "dateObserved" ],
    "attrsFormat": "normalized",
    "throttling": 1
  },

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-v2:Car:NOR:20240115' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
![postman](https://github.com/Marwenbellili72/F1_Digital_Twin/blob/main/assets/img3.png)
This will return real-time data like:

* Speed (km/h)
* RPM
* Gear
* Position (x, y)
* Throttle, Brake, DRS
* Lap number
* Observed date/time

---
## üöó F1 Car Entity (NGSI Format)
